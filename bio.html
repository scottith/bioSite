        <div class="bio-content">
            <p>Ashley Moore is a 27-year-old adventure-seeker, music enthusiast, and proud mother of two—with a third on the way this September. A firm believer in living life fully and authentically, Ashley balances the joy of raising a family with her passion for the outdoors and the arts. Whether she's loading the car for a spontaneous road trip or strapping her youngest into a hiking carrier, she finds ways to blend exploration with motherhood.</p>

            <p>Ashley has visited some of the most awe-inspiring national parks in the U.S., including Glacier, Shenandoah, Arches, and Cuyahoga Valley. Her love of hiking, camping, and kayaking is matched by her mission to introduce her kids to the same sense of wonder and freedom she finds in nature. From pitching tents under the stars to sipping coffee from a local café before hitting the trails, her adventures are both grounded and spontaneous.</p>

            <p>Outside of the wilderness, Ashley has a deep love for music—especially indie and country. Her playlist is filled with artists like Mt. Joy, The Lumineers, and Zach Bryan, and she has attended countless concerts over the years. These shared experiences, whether under a concert stage glow or beneath a mountain sunrise, form the tapestry of memories she cherishes most.</p>

            <p>Ashley’s story is one of balance—between motherhood and personal passion, between comfort and curiosity. She inspires those around her to find beauty in the journey, stay grounded in joy, and never pass up a good cup of coffee on the road.</p>
